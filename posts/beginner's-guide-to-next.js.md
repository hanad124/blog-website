# Beginner's Guide to Next.js

## Introduction

Next.js is a popular React framework that simplifies the process of building server-side rendered (SSR) React applications. It offers many features that help developers build efficient, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications.

In this beginner's guide, we will explore the key features of Next.js and learn how to build a simple web application using it.

## Why use Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages over traditional React applications. Some of the key benefits of Next.js include:

- **Server-side rendering**: Next.js allows you to render your React components on the server, which can improve the performance and SEO of your web application.
- **Automatic code splitting**: Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller chunks, which can reduce page load times and improve the user experience.
- **Zero-config setup**: Next.js provides a default configuration that works well for most projects, so you can get started quickly without worrying about setting up a complex build process.
- **Static site generation**: Next.js can generate static HTML files for your web application, which can improve performance and reduce server costs.
- **API routes**: Next.js allows you to define API routes within your application, which can be used to fetch data from external sources or perform server-side logic.

## Getting started with Next.js

To get started with `Next.js`, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Once you have those installed, you can create a new Next.js project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
```

This will create a new Next.js project in a directory called my-app. You can then navigate to the directory and start the development server using the following commands:

```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000. You can now start building your Next.js application!

## Creating pages

In Next.js, pages are defined as individual components that are rendered on the server. To create a new page, you can create a new React component in the pages directory. For example, to create a page at /about, you can create a new file called about.js in the pages directory with the following content:

```bash
function About() {
  return <h1>About</h1>;
}

export default About;
```

This will create a new page that displays the heading "About" when accessed at http://localhost:3000/about.

## Using dynamic routes

Next.js also supports dynamic routes, which allow you to generate pages based on dynamic data. To create a dynamic route, you can create a new file in the pages directory with square brackets in the filename. For example, to create a dynamic route for product pages, you can create a file called pages/products/[productId].js with the following content:

```bash
function ProductPage({ productId }) {
  return <h1>Product {productId}</h1>;
}

export async function getServerSideProps({ params }) {
  return {
    props: {
      productId: params.productId,
    },
  };
}

export default ProductPage;
```

This will create a new page that displays the product ID when accessed at http://localhost:3000/products/123.

## Fetching data

Next.js provides several ways to fetch data for your application, including using the getServerSideProps and getStaticProps functions. These functions allow you to fetch data on the server and pass it as props to your components.

For example, to fetch data from an external API and display it on a page, you can create a new file called pages/posts.js with the following content:

```bash
function Posts({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  const posts = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  };
}

export default Posts;
```

This will fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API and display it on the page.

## Conclusion

Next.js is a powerful framework that simplifies the process of building server-side rendered React applications. In this beginner's guide, we explored some of the key features of Next.js, including server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and API routes.
